      <p>Season 1's main goal is to create what we know as "The Glee Club." We watch an average teacher, William Shuester, gain joy, or rather <em>glee</em>, from creating this club. We watch the club struggle to stay funded and sit in anticipation while watching them compete against their biggest rivals, Vocal Adrenaline.</p>
