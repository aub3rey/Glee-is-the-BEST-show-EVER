<h2>What's It About</h2>
  <p> <a href="https://glee.fandom.com/wiki/Glee_(TV_Series)" target="_blank"><em>Glee</em></a> is a teen drama television show that was released by FOX in 2009. This show featured Lea Michele, Cory Monteith, Dianna Agron, Naya Rivera, Matthew Morrison, Jane Lynch, and many more. It had guest stars ranging from Demi Lovato, Britney Spears, John Stamos, and even Tyra Banks. It surrounds a glee club at William McKinley High challenging the status quo and their personal life struggles. Watchers get to live through the characters and undergo a drama-filled high school experience through the magic of music. </p>

<h2>Season 1</h2>

    </p>
<p>Season 1's main goal is to create what we know as "The Glee Club." We watch an average teacher of William McKinley High, William Shuester, gain joy, or rather <em>glee</em>, from creating this club, in Lima, Ohio. We also see an unlikely group of students become each other's founded family. As these students go through  many life struggles, the audience watches how they each individually respond, and how they act as a group. We see students who start off as the main "bullies" become some of the most loved characters and most loving people. But mostly, we watch the club struggle to stay funded and sit in anticipation while watching them compete against their biggest rivals at regionals, Vocal Adrenaline.</p>

<h2>Season 2</h2> <p align="center"> <img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/1914/43287345640_2e53139827_b.jpg" width="500" height="350"> </p>
<p>In season 2, we watch the glee club we all know and love become slightly bigger and still hated. The students are growing older, and this is shown in the storyline. The actual production of the show steps away from being very satirical and becomes more of a standard drama show. We feel less involved in their lives, while in season 1, the show felt more like we were someone in their school watching it all happen at once. Season 2 speaks out about the topics of alcohol, bullying, and even homelessness. <i>Glee</i> has always been known for not being afraid to talk about harsh topics, and this season is no different. We see the reappearance of Vocal Adrenaline and await to see the New Directions' performance at National, in New York.</p>

<h2>Season 3</h2> <p align="center"> <img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/1857/43593505835_de778a28c8_b.jpg" width="500" height="350"> </p>
<p>Season 3 is the peak of the show. We watch the kids deal with graduation or deal with their friends leaving. This is their last chance to prove themselves. This season speaks out on racial stereotypes, outing someone, and teen marriages. This season is definitely a fan favorite, as it has a lot of fan requests in it, due to the writers wanting to please the fandom. Season 3 showcases the biggest win of them all, <b>Nationals</b>! This epic win leads to the school finally accepting them, even seen in the beginning of seaons 4. In the last episode, we have to say goodbye to the majority of the main cast, as they are graduating and moving out. Despite this bittersweet ending, there is still happiness and hope for the next season.</p>

<h2>Season 4</h2>
<p align="center"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/7811/47243629461_124c55ef63_b.jpg" weight="300" height="350"></p>
<p>In season 4, we see the characters go through the struggles of college in New York, but we also see the glee club struggle with filling the places of the graduated students, especially Rachel Berry's seat. The show introduces some new characters, mostly to replace the lost ones. We see the glee club being very accepted at school, and the kids don't want to change this, so they become what they fear, <b>bullies</b>. In this season, McKinley has their first real musical, <i>Grease</i>, and the graduated kids have their first big breakup, where 2 couples break up on the same day, at the same time, and sing the same song. This season is one of the ones that fans think is unnecessary, many think it should've ended after season 3, but it does start the beginning of the end for the ungraduated kids that we met in seasons 1, 2, and 3. The timeline, however, is very confusing, as most seasons are  for 1 school year in length, but this season seems to stop at a random time. The switch off to New York and then to Lima, Ohio is very weird and confuses many watchers. In this season, topics of body dysphoria, school shootings, and guilty pleasures are talked about. Since this season isn't like the others, let's move on to season 5.</p>

<h2>Season 5</h2>
<p align="center"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/1933/43106989420_4ba31b5ea4_b.jpg" weight="500" height="350"></p>
<p>Season 5 has many things happening at once. The college kids are still in New York, but Rachel goes to Broadway. She drops out of her college, NYADA, but later regrets it. The glee kids at school are getting ready for Nationals in Los Angeles, where we get an update on Mercedes, a rising pop star. We get the 100th episode!!! In this episode,  there are many callbacks to previous episodes to commemorate the occasion. But the most important part of this season is episode 3, "The Quarterback." This is a heartbreaking episode made in dedication to Finn Hudson, played by the late Cory Monteith. In 2013, Cory Monteith passed away, and in the show, so did  Finn. They decided to express their grief in the best way they could, singing. This episode does a great job of recognizing how parents, friends, and family feel when a tragic event like this happens. This season ends with Rachel Berry moving from Broadway into her own show. The glee club has been disbanded, due to their loss at Nationals, and Will is working with Vocal Adrenaline. Many other fans think it should've ended here, but I think season six is a better ending.</p>

<h2>Season 6</h2>
<p align="center"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/3708/13389089495_1838b123c1_b.jpg" weight="500" height="350"></p>
<p>The last season of <i>Glee</i>. This show has many things to do to finish its final season. We have to finish storylines, talk about the Glee Club ending, talk about how it's going to come back, and most importantly, introduce new characters. That's right; a show with multiple characters, so many that you can't possibly name them all created more characters. After the glee club ended, all the glee students were sent away, except for Kitty Wilde. Rachel Berry, after her show failing, returned to McKinley and used the leftover money she had to revive the glee club to what it used to be, to what gave her <i>glee</i>. We watch Rachel create a team good enough to go against her old friends, Will and Blaine, who are now coaching Vocal Adrenaline and the Warblers, respectfully. This season seems rushed to many viewers, but it was because there was a lot that needed to be addressed. In season six, the writers knew it would be the last, so they wanted to incorporate as many of the fans' wishes as they possibly could, even going to the extent of a double wedding. Many things happen that seem unrealistic, but that was them reaching back to the satirical aspect of season one that everyone loved. Overall, season six was a perfect ending to the perfect show. "And that's what you missed on <i>Glee</i>."</p>
