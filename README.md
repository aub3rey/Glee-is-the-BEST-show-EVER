      <p>Season 1's main goal is to create what we know as "The Glee Club." We watch an average teacher, William Shuester, gain joy, or rather <em>glee</em>, from creating this club. We also see an unlikely group of students become each others' founded family. As these students go through  m any life struggles, the audience watches how they each individually respond, and how they act as a group. We see students that start off as the main "bullies" become some the most loved characters and most loving people. But mostly, we watch the club struggle to stay funded and sit in anticipation while watching them compete against their biggest rivals at regionals, Vocal Adrenaline.</p>
<h2>Season 2</h2> <p align="center"> <img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/1914/43287345640_2e53139827_b.jpg" width="500" height="350"> </p>
    <p>In season 2, we watch the glee club we all know and love become slightly bigger and still hated. The students are growing older, and this shows in the storyline. The actual production of the show steps away from being very satirical and becomes more of a standard drama show. We feel less involved in their lives, while in season 1, the show felt more like we were someone in their school watching it all happen at once. Season 2 speaks out about the topics of alcohol, bullying, and even homelessness. <i>Glee</i> has always been known for not being afraid to talk about harsh topics, and this season is no different. We see the reappearance of Vocal Adrenaline and await to see the New Directions' performance at National, in New York.</p>
<h2>Season 3</h2> <p align="center"> <img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/1857/43593505835_de778a28c8_b.jpg" width="500" height="350"> </p>
    <p>Season 3 is the peak of the show. We watch the kids deal with graduation or deal with their friends leaving. This is their last chance to prove themselves. This season speaks out on racial stereotypes, outing someone, and teen marriages. This season is definitely a fan favorite, as it as a lot of fan requests in it, due to the writers wanting to please the fandom. Seaon3 showcases the biggest win of them all, Nationals! This epic win leads to the school finally accepting them, even seen in the beginning of seaons 4. In the last episode, we have to say goodbye to majority of the main cast, as they are graduating and moving out. Despite this bittersweet ending, there is still happiness and hope for the next season.</p>
