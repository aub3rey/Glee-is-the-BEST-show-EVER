This show featured Lea Michele, Cory Monteith, Dianna Agron, Naya Rivera, Matthew Morrison, Jane Lynch, and many more.

    </p>
<p>Season 1's main goal is to create what we know as "The Glee Club." We watch an average teacher of William McKinley High, William Shuester, gain joy, or rather <em>glee</em>, from creating this club, in Lima, Ohio. We also see an unlikely group of students become each others' founded family. As these students go through  m any life struggles, the audience watches how they each individually respond, and how they act as a group. We see students that start off as the main "bullies" become some the most loved characters and most loving people. But mostly, we watch the club struggle to stay funded and sit in anticipation while watching them compete against their biggest rivals at regionals, Vocal Adrenaline.</p>

<h2>Season 2</h2> <p align="center"> <img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/1914/43287345640_2e53139827_b.jpg" width="500" height="350"> </p>
<p>In season 2, we watch the glee club we all know and love become slightly bigger and still hated. The students are growing older, and this shows in the storyline. The actual production of the show steps away from being very satirical and becomes more of a standard drama show. We feel less involved in their lives, while in season 1, the show felt more like we were someone in their school watching it all happen at once. Season 2 speaks out about the topics of alcohol, bullying, and even homelessness. <i>Glee</i> has always been known for not being afraid to talk about harsh topics, and this season is no different. We see the reappearance of Vocal Adrenaline and await to see the New Directions' performance at National, in New York.</p>

<h2>Season 3</h2> <p align="center"> <img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/1857/43593505835_de778a28c8_b.jpg" width="500" height="350"> </p>
<p>Season 3 is the peak of the show. We watch the kids deal with graduation or deal with their friends leaving. This is their last chance to prove themselves. This season speaks out on racial stereotypes, outing someone, and teen marriages. This season is definitely a fan favorite, as it as a lot of fan requests in it, due to the writers wanting to please the fandom. Season 3 showcases the biggest win of them all, <b>Nationals</b>! This epic win leads to the school finally accepting them, even seen in the beginning of seaons 4. In the last episode, we have to say goodbye to majority of the main cast, as they are graduating and moving out. Despite this bittersweet ending, there is still happiness and hope for the next season.</p>

<h2>Season 4</h2>
<p align="center"><img src="" weight="500" height="350"></p>
<p>In season 4, we see the characters go through the struggles of college in New York, but we also see the glee club struggle with filling the places of the graduated students, especially Rachel Berry's seat. The show introduces some new characters, mostly to replace the lost ones. We see the glee club being very accepted at school, and the kids don't want to change this, so they become what they fear, <b>bullies</b>. In this season, McKinley has their first real musical, <i>Grease</i>, and the graduated kids have their first big breakup, where 2 couple sbreak up on the same day, at the same time, and sing the same song. This season is one of the ones that fans think is unnecessary, many think it should've ended after season 3, but it does start the beginning of the end for the ungraduated kids that we met in seasons 1, 2, and 3. The timeline, however, is very confusing, as most seasons are  for 1 school year in length, but this season seems to stop at a random time. The switch off to New York and then to Lima, Ohio is very weird and confuses many watchers.</p>
